# Lysol-XYZ-DBoard
An edited version of the daughter board that was used on XYZ's B-KEN_KO.
This version of the xyz dboard uses the same pinout as c3 unified dboard used on many other boards and other vendors sell. 

This version exists because the original lacked a resetable fuse for over current as well as a diode for some over volt protection. 

There's a pre made panel gerber/project file as well as a BOM and CPL file for JLCPCB prodution and assembly that'll make around 225 dboards from one order at the minimum of 5 panels/pcbs. if you need to change anything bom wise, i'd suggest doing so through the JLCPCB KIcad v6 plugin for easy modifications.
