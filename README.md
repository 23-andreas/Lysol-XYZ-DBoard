# Lysol-XYZ-DBoard
An edited version of the daughter board that was used on XYZ's B-KEN_KO.
This version of the xyz dboard uses the same pinout as c3 unified dboard used on many other boards and other vendors sell. 

This version exists because the original alcked a resetable fuse for over current protection. 

There's a pre made panel gerber/project file as well as a BOM and CPL file for JLCPCB prodution and assembly. if you need to change anything bom wise, i'd suggest doing so through the JLCPCB KIcad v6 plugin for easy modifications.
